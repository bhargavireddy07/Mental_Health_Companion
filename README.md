# Mental_Health_Companion
Mental health is an important issue in the world today. With a large population now working from home and staying away from loved ones, the mental health situation has deteriorated. As such, it becomes important to know if a requires mental health treatment before they get too serious. The project focuses on building a mental health prediction model. We try to get an idea of the mental state of your user (in the least intrusive ways). The next step is taking the answers to certain important questions that are considered significant to analyze their mental health state. This project involves building a simple interface. A user answers some questions and based on the answers that they provide, we will predict if they require mental health treatment or not and display it. 

Mental health entails more than the absence of mental illnesses. Mental health issues affect the entire population, not just a tiny, isolated portion. Hence, we all need to invest our time, and technology toward a healthy mind.
